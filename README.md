Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to explain the requirement analysis topic in software development and all that it entails. Requirement Analysis focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for a software's development by documenting, analyzing and structuring requirements.

What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is a phase in the software development lifecycle where the project team gathers, analyzes and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. It has a lot of importance among them clarity and understanding for stakeholders to know what to expect from the software, scope definition to help prevent scope creep, basis for design and development which provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system, cost and time estimation and quality assurance of the software product.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important
Requirement analysis is a key critical phase in the developement lifecycle due to the following reasons: it brings clarity and understanding for what stakeholders expect from the software, scope definition to help prevent scope creep, basis for design and development, cost and time estimation to enable facilitators keep accurate estimation of costs and quality assurance which ensures the final product meets the specified requirements which leads to higher customer satisfaction.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering : This activity involves conducting interviews with stakeholders, distributing surveys, organizing workshops, observing end users and document analysis.
Requirement Elicitation : This actvity involves conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements, holding focus discussions with selected stakeholders and creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system.
Requirement Documentation : Involves creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non functional requirements, writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user pers
Requirement Analysis and Modelling : Involves prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project, assessing the feasibility of requirements and creating models to visualize and analyze requirements.
Requirement Validation : Involves reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness, defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement and establishing traceability to ensure all requirements are addressed during development.

Tpes of Requirement
Functional Requirements : These describe what the system should do examples are user authentication, property search, booking system and user registration.
Non functional Requirements : These describe how the system should perform examples are perfomance, security, scalability, usability and reliability.
